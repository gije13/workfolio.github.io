                <h1>Competitor audit services</h1>
                <p>One of the first things we’ll do for your business is provide you with a full Competitor audit. In the audit, we’ll evaluate every competitor and compile a report of what’s working and what isn’t. The report will break down every aspect of your competitors strategy and determine what we could improve. In addition, we’ll offer recommendations on how to improve them. In fact, if your business has over four employees and spends more than $1000 per month on Ads, you qualify for a free PPC audit! Just get in touch with us to get started.</p>
